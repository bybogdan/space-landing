# Space Landing

## Ambiguities in Task and Layout Descriptions

- incorrectly specified second text color for the "Travelling into space is one of the most exciting and unforgettable adventures that can change ..." in figma shown as #ffffff, but in the layout it is look like grey color. I used #808080 for me looks similar to the layout.
- not the same indents (for example in the header top and bottom indents for logo is 24px top and 20.89px bottom) used 24 for both.

# TODO

- Fix busket color
- Fix cards grid, card view on screens of different sizes
- Add text block
